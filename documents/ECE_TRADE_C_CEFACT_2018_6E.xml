<title>Introduction: What is Paperless Trading?</title>
<clause id="_836be37c-941b-ecc3-bf1b-c129ea5455a6" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_9a5982cf-60a4-09e0-c086-49e0da880d4c">When goods and services cross borders in international trade, information needs to be passed between relevant parties, whether private companies or public bodies, including suppliers, logistics providers, customs, regulatory agencies, sellers and buyers. Paperless trade refers to the digitization of these information flows, including making available and enabling the exchange of trade-related data and documents electronically. Less formally, one can think of this as cross-border trade transactions using electronic data in lieu of paper-based documents.</p></clause>

<clause id="_d5cef542-11cd-0b8e-4ad7-cb0300dab5a4" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_8f058314-176c-8413-3409-0bdc0f50fd33">Transforming what was traditionally a paper-based documentation system into an electronic format can speed up trade and ease the cost of doing business in today’s interconnected world. Bottlenecks in supply chain management and regulatory documentation can be particularly tricky for smaller businesses or e-traders with less experience and resources. Paperless trading, therefore, serves as a promising means to deal with the logistical challenges of e-commerce and, in particular, small shipments across borders. Overall, it is quickly becoming an essential component of governmental efforts to improve the efficiency of customs controls and trade administration processes, and of ensuring trade competitiveness in a rapidly digitizing world.</p></clause>

<clause id="_968d7e78-b21c-39b0-4b5a-03f4eaee0c31" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_57b489f2-61d3-f716-3ae7-699c7c3bb7cb">How exactly is a trade transaction rendered paperless? Digitized exchange can be done in several ways. One way is simply to take a visual snapshot of a paper document – either a scanned or a PDF version. Another possibility is an internet web portal where individual data elements can be keyed in – this is known as data-trader interface (DTI). Paperless transactions can also be conducted using fully electronic messages – known as electronic data interchange (EDI), with formats including UN/EDIFACT, XML, JSON and other web services. Typically, these systems would provide an application-programming interface (API) to facilitate interaction with the database.</p></clause>

<clause id="_47ba3334-53a5-7601-e59a-f4842b6ef201" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_60af6eb3-a2ef-cb48-b0dd-ad7ddcd0b902">At first glance, the task of moving from paper-based to paperless administration of trade may seem relatively straightforward. However, because of the need to coordinate electronically across borders, the impetus for international cooperation rises once trade is rendered paperless. Governments use a variety of arrangements, including United Nations (UN) agencies and standards-setting organizations, as well as trade agreements, to establish the governance structures necessary for paperless trading. This white paper provides an overview of these efforts, which take place across a wide variety of disparate institutions, some of which lie outside the traditional institutions associated with trade governance.</p></clause>

<clause id="_e06129e9-5ca8-f6bd-eeb4-c21806b3a956" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_2c1a8c4e-dbbf-7a97-a5fa-79b3523c4cf3">The paper is written especially with trade policy-makers in mind to assist their considerations on how best to align trade rules with current and expected future trends in paperless trading. The paper is also intended to provide other stakeholders with a better understanding of existing efforts and possible future developments at the intersection of paperless trading and international trade administration to guide their inputs for trade policy.</p></clause>

<clause id="_98c5d72b-71bd-a994-8168-9ac65e4f59e9" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_5c962cf2-137f-8d2b-cee6-b7eaa941d170">Because of the wide variety of issues associated with paperless trading, it is important to establish boundaries in the scope of what is considered in this paper. Though scanned/PDF files can present benefits, this white paper concentrates primarily on transactions conducted through electronic messages. Electronic messages afford even greater opportunities for tapping into the benefits of paperless trading thanks to the potential reuse of data, the elimination of the need to re-key data into a computer at each supply chain checkpoint, and the reduction in potential human error. Note that aspects of this paper may apply to DTI and APIs as well.</p></clause>

<clause id="_902f3abb-7de8-9af3-04b3-cd5378c22b91" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_e40ec302-d2e9-2eb8-645b-e79b24db75bd">The paper is also specifically focused on paperless trade as defined by the technical international trade community. This encompasses electronic forms of trade administration documents that are business-to-government (B2G) as well as business-to-business (B2B) electronic exchange of information within international trade context. The term “paperless trade”, however, can be used by other communities in a broader sense to refer to the electronic exchange of data in a purely national commercial and regulatory context. For example, banks may refer to paperless trade as applied to trade finance processes – which may also have an international component. Further, different stakeholders may diverge on where the line may be drawn on what is considered paperless trade as applied to trade administration documents versus the broader digital commercial universe. The potential for different starting points on paperless trade should be kept in mind when engaging in dialogue on the topic.</p></clause>

<clause id="_f8d975dc-347e-8f06-d4bb-4811a3e8bbb3" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_7031d5a0-7086-1d78-0b90-ec13261d27ef">The paper is a part of a series run by the World Economic Forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO) focused on e-commerce policy best practices. The inclusion of paperless trade in the series is from both the perspective of the digitalization of trade processes as well as the specific benefits this may have for small businesses using electronic platforms to engage in global trade.</p></clause>

<title>How Does Paperless Trading Work?</title>
<clause id="_481a9dd1-6f85-9dc1-b81c-3543e70c74d7" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_aa047c4c-73af-ebab-7165-f3389574c0e6">While many may be familiar with the concept of paperless trading, the mechanics of how exactly paperless trading works is one that most individuals involved with trade, whether from business or government, will have given little thought. Like many other elements of our digital world, it is simply a technical development that is taken for granted. However, a basic overview of how it works in practice and the benefits may help inform debate on the need for cross-border cooperation on technical issues.</p></clause>

<clause id="_292337c5-aa6d-faef-4358-305b3f4c7aec" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_85288ac9-ef8e-99c7-c976-c4cae518bb83">For parties to exchange and reuse fully electronic messages, all information needs to be clearly defined and unambiguous, both from a semantic and syntactical perspective. Trading partners wanting to exchange data will need to agree on the meaning of each individual data element to ensure that they all understand the information in the same way. This is equally true for governments and any other parties that may use or transmit this data. If the exchange is limited to two parties, a bilateral data dictionary is sufficient. As soon as there are multiple parties, however, or if the information may be reused in other contexts, a standardized data dictionary is useful.</p></clause>

<clause id="_3e61aa54-6c2b-4bec-636b-e5bc8eea9edf" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_b5aaa662-2796-bb36-09dd-7ba0fadd91c5">When a commercial order is received, a system configured to use EDI messages can prepare all the necessary documents (or messages) to enable processing – such as packing list, delivery note, invoice and customs declaration. The system can also potentially manage reorders for stock replenishment and link to other entities to order transport, request certificates or arrange other services.</p></clause>

<clause id="_28a21737-ca91-d71e-148c-ca19dbbc3a88" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_29bc75e6-655d-cd8b-5923-ed24eb4ef755">Code lists are another important part of moving from paper to electronic messages. Any information that can be codified should be codified to avoid confusion. For example, in English alone, packaging material that is palletized can be described as slab, board, honeycomb slate and so on, before even taking into account differences between languages. Humans might understand that each of these means palletized or stacked on pallet transport structures, but a computer, unless it has been programmed to recognize all the variations, will not necessarily understand that these are the synonymous terms. However, if “palletized” is indicated using a code, there is no ambiguity.</p></clause>

<clause id="_ef53608f-e057-4b6e-dc88-39f290004004" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_bd3ffa71-5c65-4b2a-85dc-82db5e33d405">The technical challenges of facilitating paperless trade have been addressed by governments and supply chain actors in various forums and formats. UN agencies have played a key role in developing international standards for the electronic representation of information required for trade documentation – helping to boost connectivity and interoperability. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) founded the Working Party on Facilitation of International Trade (WP.4) as early as 1961 to “`facilitate international trade and transport by promoting rationalization of trade procedures and the effective use for this purpose of electronic or other automatic data processing and transmission.`”<fn reference="1"><p id="_89ce4109-d1ef-72c3-6dc0-2f5fa61d02e3">Terms of Reference of the Facilitation of International Trade Procedures: <link target="http://www.unece.org/trade/facil/wp4_tor.htm"/> (link as of 09/2017)</p>

<title>Benefits for Traders</title>
<clause id="_cc498df9-53c3-505b-ab86-2ce0deb3919a" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_a0c3f7f1-c2ee-4929-5fe7-07375fd71f50">Over the past two decades, global trade has been increasingly defined by complex international production networks. Modern commerce is no longer an exchange between two parties but rather an extended collaboration between critical interdependent partners executed over vast geographic expanses, time zones and borders. The degree to which partners in a B2B context are proficient and make use of the network defines their success, hinged on the ability to process information using the internet and messaging protocols. The rise and spread of the internet, and with it the ability to send electronic files, radically transformed business information-sharing models – often allowing a number of authorized trading partners to stay updated simultaneously thereby keeping the entire network in sync. Paperless trade systems streamline the flow of information in global supply chains by simplifying the exchange of necessary documents or contractual elements – whether B2B or B2G – that accompany inputs crossing borders multiple times.</p></clause>

<clause id="_81f1259c-99a4-19d0-15a6-e001887339e0" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_ff7c17a1-7032-6b6a-b48d-555501fff210">As such, paperless systems can generate savings for traders through faster movement of goods as well as greater efficiency at border agencies where the exchange involves trade administration documents. Data exchanged includes purchasing orders, inventory reports, and digital sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) certificates, among others. Paperless trade can also help businesses meet regulatory compliance obligations more efficiently and at a lower cost – whether the concept is applied in a domestic or international context.</p></clause>

<clause id="_a789a7d4-b1a9-ca3c-b8f2-2f88c1c7b3de" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_cd1b560c-b1dd-352d-8f04-6e151a6b0b3d">In some countries operating manual systems, official processes are also accompanied by steps added over time, resulting in systems littered with exceptions and complexity – for example, differing from point of entry to another. Dematerializing trade administration processes can help to create a system that is more difficult to modify informally.</p></clause>

</fn> E-traders may have more limited resources to manage additional trade documentation, or doing so for relatively low value parcels may be uneconomical. For example, one survey found that where EDI files were not accepted in some countries, each parcel needed to be declared individually (contents, dimensions and weight).<fn reference="3"><p id="_63aef13c-b859-062e-a5a2-2a1f9968c994"><link target="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/wkshop_june13_e/ecom_national_board_e.pdf"/> (link as of 09/2017)</p>

Using this approach, companies can hold as little stock as possible, ordering merchandise when it needs to be sold or used. Modern supply chains must equally adapt to ever-shortening production lifecycles, consumer tastes and rapid technological developments. Without electronic messages in the supply chain, these developments would be difficult.</p></clause>

<clause id="_68cc1b5d-e71e-9e11-4fe5-03d02f8936ee" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_0b92589b-3294-1433-fbe3-49d0c14a8cb0">Further, paperless trade systems have facilitated the emergence of “third-party logistics” (3PL) players that offer elements of distribution and fulfilment for clients. These play a vital role in the planning and execution of global trade. Some commercial solutions – such as customs APIs – offered by several logistics services providers can particularly help e-traders navigate customs clearance by enabling the integration of shipping and regulatory processes into their business systems and websites. Some logistics providers also offer landed cost calculators for e-traders to display the full cost of the product – including customs duties, shipping and transport – upfront to potential buyers and mitigate potential conflicts.<fn reference="5"><p id="_44b3b705-f595-7f8c-07c7-ca192d590d25"><link target="https://www.clarity-ventures.com/ecommerce/-all-features/cutting-edge-logistics-integrations/customs-and-duties-integration"/> (link as of 09/2017)</p>
</fn> More broadly, the operational side of trade today hinges on the inclusion of third-party specialists covering freight forwarders, quality-assurance teams, customs brokers and transport carriers for ocean, air and road – many of which deploy dematerialized processes in a B2B context.</p></clause>

<title>Benefits for Governments</title>
<clause id="_42f3dc1f-92f2-c9b7-43c1-f97e9c332789" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><p id="_10e31729-d1aa-2087-4623-e4b297bec4bc">By enabling real-time information on the location and status of a shipment, paperless trade can improve transparency and traceability. As supply chains become more complex, traceability has been sought by consumers, business and governments across all manner of products, to ensure labour, environmental and other standards. While traceability can be achieved through paper-based systems, digital systems are timelier and can reduce fraud. On the latter, paperless trade can help to tackle illegal and counterfeit trade or trade-based money-laundering by increasing the visibility on exported goods and easily exposing trades that make no commercial sense. Paperless trade can also help governments more efficiently to address growing security concerns and the need to ensure there are no potential threats hidden in commercial packages. Electronic data exchange, where two governments have agreed to do so, can enable a better tracking of the value of goods declared – in some manual systems, exporters might over-declare to maximize tax recovery, while an importer might under-declare to pay less import duties.

Almost all single windows implemented today are electronic systems with a web-based interface. As such, running an electronic single window usually requires the ability to process electronic message exchanges.

In Senegal, for instance, the implementation of the electronic single window reduced the border pre- clearance and clearance processing time by 90%, from an average of two weeks to just one day.

</fn> Single-window implementation may pose a bigger challenge for countries more reliant on imports due to complexity. Some systems may also not satisfy the five-point definition of a “single window” – whether because there is not a governmental mandate resulting in multiple systems or there is not a clear single entry point. Where single windows do not distribute information to all relevant regulatory bodies, traders may still need to submit information several times.</p></clause>

Further, if paperless trade is to be effective in the international trade- enabling context, governments must accept data at customs and within regulatory agencies without also requiring original paper documentation. In other words, a paperless system that still requires the submission of paper-based documents at some point in the trading chain destroys much of the value of the digital tools for traders.</p></clause>

<p id="_40510c27-0b47-3855-0dae-3f757f7dde74">The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and e-Business (UN/CEFACT) is an intergovernmental body of the UNECE. It develops policy recommendations and standards based on public and private sector collaboration. Work on these deliverables requires the support of at least three UN Members. Completed projects are presented to the UN/CEFACT Plenary – which any UN Member can join – for approval. In this way, all countries can participate in the standardization process. All results are available free of charge.</p>

<p id="_76ffdca5-9b2e-34ee-e776-a883851c2be5">UN/CEFACT aims to be a semantic hub for data elements. It maintains a Core Component Library (CCL) that serves as an encyclopedia of data elements and includes inputs from other organizations with electronic business standards; this is outlined in a multilateral MoU between UNECE and the International Standards Organization (ISO), International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). A long-term objective is to harmonize various data elements and render the base semantics compatible between different standards bodies.

WTO Members are required to base their technical regulations for trade in goods on international standards or to explain why deviation is necessary. Awareness of the existing international standards, and the institutions through which these standards are established, is important for trade policy-making. This is especially the case if paperless trading systems at the border will be integrated with domestic regulatory systems concerning the distribution and sale of goods behind the border.</p></clause>

The UN Layout Key was developed in the 1960s to standardize the representation of information on trade documents.

The UN Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/EDIFACT) was one pioneer in this area – effectively replacing some paper documents from the mid-1980s onwards.

Some messages are developed by other organizations and then submitted to UN/CEFACT to be harmonized and entered into the official directories. The messages are identified by a six-character name, such as INVOIC for invoice or CUSDEC for a customs declaration, and the information is organized into groupings, similar to those found on paper documents including importer information, product details, payment conditions, and so on.

This EDI syntax provides higher flexibility in the structure, length and format, often making it more attractive. However, there is no single, centrally maintained XML version – there could potentially be as many XML languages as business partners. Other technical disadvantages include larger data files. UN/CEFACT does offer a standardized XML, as do some International Organization of Standards (ISO) committees, the World Customs Organization (WCO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and others. The UN/CEFACT approach to XML has been to start standardizing the processes and then the data related to each process is to contain before creating XML messages.

The European Union has decided that all public institutions must accept and may require electronic invoices, as part of a wider drive to decrease the use of paper. Two standards should be used to ensure interoperability, one of which is the UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice (CII).

But this is only partially true; implementation requires, first and foremost, a high-level political consensus, policy frameworks, supporting laws and legislation and an institutional set-up.

UN/CEFACT plays a key role in developing trade facilitation recommendations targeting high-level policy-makers that typically touch on specific aspects of paperless trade.

The TFA is also crafted to take into account individual country situations and capacities. To benefit from the special and differential treatment provisions found in the agreement, WTO Members must categorize and notify their ability to fulfil each provision and may signal the need for support for implementation.

Specific articles on paperless trading often take the form of soft, rather than hard binding commitments where negotiators use language such as “shall endeavour”. The provision is usually accompanied by a definition of trade administration documents.<fn reference="25"><p id="_3da310e6-9c4b-d000-043f-46c2077d26a0">WTO research notes that this typically refers to forms issued or controlled by the government of a party, which must be completed by or for an importer or exporter in relation to the import of export of goods. The FTA between Japan and Switzerland is the only agreement notified to the WTO that extends the definition to forms that a party issues or controls that must be completed by a services supplier.

</fn> Paperless trading provisions frequently require that a government make publicly available electronic versions of all trade administration documents – sometimes specifying a time-delineated implementation goal. These also typically require the government to accept trade administration documents submitted electronically as the legal equivalent of the paper version of such document.</p></clause>

An FTA between Chile and Australia, for example, refers to the development of a single window with cross- referencing between the e-commerce and customs chapters. Several FTAs see parties pledge to use international standards or methods when developing paperless trade systems, which can be a good way to ensure interoperability.</p></clause>

This can take the form of sharing experiences on regulations, laws and programmes on e-commerce and e-government – with the latter a proxy for paperless trading – or regulatory dialogue. A limited number of agreements require parties to cooperate bilaterally and in international forums to enhance the acceptance of electronic versions of trade administration documents. The Japan-Singapore FTA commits parties to encourage cooperation between relevant private entities engaged in paperless trading and establishes a joint committee on paperless trade geared towards reviewing implementation issues.</p></clause>

These include the Australia-China FTA, Australia-Malaysia FTA, Australia- Singapore FTA, Australia-Thailand FTA and New Zealand-Thailand FTA. Each of these agreements allows limited exceptions if there is a “domestic or international legal requirement to the contrary” or if paperless trading would “reduce the effectiveness of the trade administration process”.</p></clause>

It included acceptance of electronic copies; e-submission of trade-related documents such as SPS certification; electronic customs systems; e-certification and e-signature, including mutual recognition; and international standards. Besides the TPP, other FTAs with a broad scope of coverage include the US-Republic of Korea FTA and several other recent Korean FTAs (such as those with China and Viet Nam).</p></clause>

While the EU has focused on building paperless trading systems for its members, FTAs negotiated by the European Commission tend not to put as much emphasis on paperless trading as compared to those negotiated by the US, Australia, Republic of Korea, or others. The EU agreement with Colombia and Peru includes the commitment to endeavour to make trade management documents available electronically and to accept electronic documents as the legal equivalent of paper.

The treaty is designed to provide new tools and a digital complement for implementing the TFA and facilitating cross-border commerce. Among other things, it will help to promote general principles to enable the exchange and mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents in electronic form. Some estimates suggest full implementation could boost Asia-Pacific exports by as much as $257 billion annually, while the time taken to export could fall by 44%.

However, this does not optimize the information being gathered. Most documents are part of a chain of information exchanges and a good deal of information tends to be repeated at each step whether on the paper document or an electronic equivalent.</p></clause>

Each electronic message in the chain only needs to contain new information, rather than repeating redundant information. The approach implies rethinking how information is exchanged. It also corresponds more closely to the one-time data entry called for in single windows, as defined in UNECE Recommendation 33, and is closer to concepts behind blockchain technology. UN/CEFACT has produced Reference Data Models that support this approach.</p></clause>

However, it is important to keep in mind the individual agendas of organizations that push their standards, or that disparage another standard. Many IT companies will make a living off complicated data exchange so it may not be in their interest to have an interoperable system. This is sometimes the case for certain governments or government administrations as well. Nevertheless, as more and more trade and international business processes move online, ensuring interoperability and interconnectivity between systems would help to maximize the benefits of the digital economy. This is as much a strategic regulatory choice as it is a business case.</p></clause>

To date, most RTAs have not used such language – with a few exceptions in the Asia-Pacific region – except on cooperation and information exchange provisions. What type of principles or cooperative approach could the WTO take? What could be learned from the TFA in terms of graduated levels of commitment and binding?</p></clause>

As well as growing prevalence in FTAs, regional initiatives to promote interoperable paperless trading systems are also proceeding, including the UNESCAP paperless trade governance framework. As another example, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies’ 1998 Blueprint for Action on Electronic Commerce included a pledge on reducing the requirement for paper documents for customs or other cross-border trade administration by 2005 for developed economies and by 2010 for developing economies, or as soon as possible thereafter.

For example, Australia and New Zealand are putting in place an e-commerce “green lane” trial to allow for more seamless movement of low-risk goods through the international mail stream between the two countries. The move is driven by recognition of the increasing volume of low-value e-commerce items in the mail stream. The aim is to pre-screen and pre-clear e-commerce goods using data, enabling faster border clearance, improving efficiency of processes, and directing organizational resources towards high-risk goods. The trial is consistent with a WCO-UPU global model for data exchange between customs and posts, agreed in 2012. The trial will use the WCO-UPU Data Model message formats to support the implementation of Electronic Advance Data (EAD) between post and customs, enabled by the UPU CDS.POST IT platform. To ensure the quality of data, e- traders will be encouraged to provide item-level data electronically.</p></clause>

UN/LOCODE is also a recommendation code list and aims to identify all locations linked to international trade; it is essential for the clear identification of locations in the maritime and other transport industries as well as customs. The second are code lists that are maintained within UN/EDIFACT; there are many more of these including, among others, types of documents, types of contracts, types of dates, party function and business function.

These SPS certificates serve as an official communication from the competent authority of the exporting country to the competent authority of the importing country that the cargo meets minimum sanitary requirements. Paper certificates can be costly, are logistically complicated and difficult to protect against fraud. Electronic certificates are also much more accurate than paper certificates. Electronic certificates will lower the number of interceptions and reduce time in ports. Countries are increasingly shifting to electronic customs and port clearance systems to enable better risk management. As a result, relevant regulatory bodies – including IPPC, OIE and CODEX – have recognized electronic certification as an alternative to paper certificates.</p></clause>

The project used a step-wise, confidence- building approach, with the two parties initially exchanging information on standards and technology, then subsequently using certificates both in electronic and paper form, and finally moving to a fully digitized system.</p></clause>

Questions arose, however, around ensuring the authenticity of the document. Paper certificates are in most cases produced on security paper and signed and stamped to provide a proof of integrity and authentication. As a result, each electronic message containing the SPS certificate was accompanied by an electronic signature using the XMLDSig standard of the W3C. The management of the electronic signature was based on the FIPS 140-2 (National Institute of Standards and Technology of the USA) standard terms of technology and procedures. The shift also required legal frameworks that recognized the electronic signature.</p></clause>

These Cargo-XML messaging standards are used by the airlines for end-to-end cargo business, fulfil customs’ advance cargo information (ACI) and filing requirements and provide compliance with regulators’ security requirements. The use of core components from the UN/CEFACT data library (CCL) makes the IATA Cargo-XML standards multi-modal and compatible for cross-border movements allowing interoperability between various systems and stakeholders. For example, the IATA Cargo-XML standard is compatible with the WCO Data Model, since both are based on UN/CEFACT core components.</p></clause>

The new data standard improves data quality and simplifies communications across the supply chain facilitating trade growth, helping with cargo security, modernizing customs operations and fostering participation in global commerce through advance electronic data submission for air cargo shipments. It also facilitates customs risk assessments for air cargo shipments and improves compliance with security regulations.</p></clause>

Carriers flying into Jamaica are required to provide advance information for air waybill, house waybill and flight manifest to Jamaica customs prior to flight arrival using respective IATA Cargo-XML standards. The project is helping to set a foundation for paperless trade; modernizing customs operations; driving better trade efficiency and competitiveness; enhancing security; boosting compliance by carriers with regulatory requirements; and reducing paper waste. Together, these benefits help to lower trade costs, with savings passed on to business and consumers.</p></clause>

This included strategic alignment between Jamaican customs, UNCTAD and IATA through regular dialogue to develop a business and IT strategy. The dialogue resulted in the recognition of the WCO SAFE Framework (standards to secure and facilitate global trade) and IATA standard messages, legislative amendments and a roadmap for implementation. There was also a need for resource and implementation planning. Customs and IATA agreed on the implementation approach, as well as filing schedule, amendment and cancellation rules. Customs obtained the necessary documentation (e.g. IATA Cargo-XML Toolkit) and related IATA support. The overall solution initially ran as a pilot. IATA engaged relevant stakeholders to start filing data. UNCTAD and Jamaican customs fine- tuned the solution in accordance with the pilot findings. Jamaican customs, UNCTAD and IATA also developed user guidance and industry communication material such as the filing standards, timelines, responsible parties and compliance conditions, including final enforcement date. IATA is now pursuing a similar approach with other countries for ACI implementation.</p></clause>

The Italian banking system consequently developed a model that enables the transmission and issuing of e-invoices. Currently, e-invoice standards in use are proprietary, as defined by the Italian government by specific tags. In the near future, however, the government will be obliged to also support international standards, among which is the UN/CEFACT cross-industry invoice format that has been included in the official EU directive list.</p></clause>

A data pipeline aims to capture data at its source and manage information along the supply chain, with each actor adding just the information pertinent to their operations.</p></clause>

The pipeline, which was originally meant to provide more accuracy in the data sent to government authorities, is also being used to improve supply- chain transparency. Large retail companies execute hundreds of orders and receive many goods containers daily. Until now, opening a container was much like opening a present – uncertain of what would be inside. The pipeline approach allows several larger retailers to directly link the goods ordered to the container and have better visibility of when it will arrive. The data captured at source also allows importers to verify shipments before they actually leave the supplier, helping to avoid errors in supply and packing.</p></clause>

Information can be lost between the steps of traditional paper-driven processes. This may affect the bay plan, such as temperature requirements or actual weights. Putting a heavy container on the upper decks of a ship may cause it to capsize and putting goods that require special attention because of temperature on lower decks may cause these to catch fire and cause disasters. The pipeline approach has already enabled several cases to be identified and avoided.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT has developed a pipeline standard based on the experience of these EU projects. In parallel, the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library (CCL) – an encyclopaedia of all data required for international transactions – has been organized into Reference Data Models that provide only information relevant to a specific area of activity such as logistics or supply chains. As the entire CCL contains information pertinent to all cross-border activity, such as logistics, finance, agriculture, tourism and so on, finding information for a single domain can be difficult with the added information from others. These Reference Data Models, combined with the pipeline approach, enable an event-driven process, communicating snippets of information instead of entire documents. An event-driven process is essential for full Single Window implementation or the eventual application of blockchain technologies to paperless trade.</p></clause>

For example, before Ruago port – a city in Jiangsu province on the eastern coast of China – was assigned with UN/LOCODE, exporters could only deliver goods to Shanghai to then be transported the rest of the journey by highway. For one importer of stone materials, this cost of about around 4,000 renminbi per container – acting as a significant cost draft. After a UN/LOCODE was assigned to Ruago port in 2014, the importer saved about 1.2 billion renminbi annually as the containers are delivered directly.</p></clause>

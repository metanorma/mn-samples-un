This briefing note discusses the importance of clear semantic data-exchange standards and how this supports both the World Trade Organizationâ€™s Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA) as well as the United Nations SDGs. The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) aims to be the semantic hub for all trade-related data-exchange standards.</p>

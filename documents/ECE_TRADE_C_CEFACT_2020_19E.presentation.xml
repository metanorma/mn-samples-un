The Estonian Parliament will use AI for more faithful transcriptions of sessions. The Government of Estonia has stimulated joint projects, both public and private, through match-making events and through encouraging the use of AI in the private sector. Estonia aims to be a major test bed of AI. This implies rethinking some public structures such as education to prepare tomorrow’s leaders and technicians.

The evolution of Artificial Intelligence is happening very quickly — but in specific locations and specific sectors. This makes it very difficult to regulate them. The scope can also be very different for each potential solution; it is therefore necessary to imagine what the future will be with transformative technologies. How do we find a balance and not over-regulate? Who will benefit from these technologies (e.g. civil society, citizens, government agencies, technical companies) and should these actors have a role in their regulation? What role can intergovernmental agencies play? The speaker reminded attendees that some of the pitfalls include the changing nature of transformative technologies and emphasized that any regulations need to be future-proof in order to remain relevant. Learning and monitoring will play a major role in the future.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

Technologies formerly considered cutting edge, which have now become standard use (such as the use of cloud technology). Today, countries like Switzerland are working more and more to improve connectivity, especially for IoT devices. Implementation requires synergies between the readiness of the user community, the reliability of the technologies, the availability of data/standards, and the enabling infrastructure. IoT uses and the connection that these can have with blockchain technology were briefly presented.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

In certain cases, linking digital technologies to the bio markers of the product, based on DNA technology, allows for the tracking of a product throughout its lifecycle. A bio marker allows the final product to be traced back, though each phase of its evolution, to its origins. Such bio markers can be applied to gems, precious metals, and natural or man-made textiles.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

Within information security, there are three pillars: authentication (identify the origin of the transaction and only genuine parties have access); confidentiality (of all or part of the data); and integrity (to ensure that no one can contest the data). One approach to address this is the traditional PKI approach. Another is a blockchain approach, which is excellent for integrity but not necessarily for identity and not for confidentiality. There are advantages and disadvantages in both approaches. Solutions will generally require a combination of these technologies.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

The Public Sector should take a role in implementing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Estonia has set up a task force to study such use. The Estonian Parliament will use AI for more faithful transcriptions of sessions. The Government of Estonia has stimulated joint projects, both public and private, through match-making events and through encouraging the use of AI in the private sector. Estonia aims to be a major test bed of AI. This implies rethinking some public structures such as education to prepare tomorrow’s leaders and technicians.

The evolution of Artificial Intelligence is happening very quickly — but in specific locations and specific sectors. This makes it very difficult to regulate them. The scope can also be very different for each potential solution; it is therefore necessary to imagine what the future will be with transformative technologies. How do we find a balance and not over-regulate? Who will benefit from these technologies (e.g. civil society, citizens, government agencies, technical companies) and should these actors have a role in their regulation? What role can intergovernmental agencies play? The speaker reminded attendees that some of the pitfalls include the changing nature of transformative technologies and emphasized that any regulations need to be future-proof in order to remain relevant. Learning and monitoring will play a major role in the future.</p></clause>

Within information security, there are three pillars: authentication (identify the origin of the transaction and only genuine parties have access); confidentiality (of all or part of the data); and integrity (to ensure that no one can contest the data). One approach to address this is the traditional PKI approach. Another is a blockchain approach, which is excellent for integrity but not necessarily for identity and not for confidentiality. There are advantages and disadvantages in both approaches. Solutions will generally require a combination of these technologies.</p></clause>

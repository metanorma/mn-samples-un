Many paper forms will request specific information such as consignor or consignee, which provides a certain structure; however, depending on the business context and which stakeholder is questioned, such information can be interpreted differently by any recipient. Some paper forms will provide a specific number of spaces: for example, allowing a maximum of three letters (for Yes or No), In this case, responding to a question with “it depends” will exceed the space and should not be possible. The UN Layout Key as defined in UNECE Recommendation 1 describes a way of harmonizing paper document layouts to maximize standardized reading of the data across international trade paper documents. Whilst this has helped since its introduction in the 1970s, it remains a manual human process to access the data, i.e. the data cannot be automatically processed.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

The consignor, the buyer, the importer or the freight forwarder are identified in fields dedicated to entering this specific information. An address will usually not be provided as a box of free text, but rather structured in the following manner: address line1, address line2, city name, zip code, country.

The base principle of XML is that there are tags which identify types of information with an opening tag and a closing tag containing the same text as the opening tag but preceded by a slash. For example: “&#x3c;importer&#x3e;XXX&#x3c;/importer&#x3e;.” In this example, it is clear that the information which is being transmitted concerns the importer; the name of the importer here is “XXX.”</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

If there are multiple partners each has their own data exchange syntax, then each one requires a separate mapping. If there is information that is not clearly defined in a data exchange, approximations must be made; these can later cause problems if the type of information they contain is not harmonized.

However, enormous amounts of data are necessary to ensure that the links between different message structures are correct. For common information available on most commercial exchanges, such as traders’ names and addresses, this may be easy to establish. Less frequent information is less likely to be correctly understood.

For this reason, most government-run electronic systems will dictate the data to be submitted. This is often defined with national or regional legally mandated regulatory requirements in mind and these may or may not be based on international semantic standards. In contrast, the private sector will often define their data exchange requirements based on the business processes needed to support their trading (not necessarily regulations). This means that when traders are connecting to regulatory systems, they are forced to do a mapping from their trading data semantics to the regulatory data semantics of the government. As with the bridges described above, this can result in misinterpretations and mis-mappings that can be unintentionally (or possibly undetectably intentionally) detrimental to risk assessment and evaluations.</semantic__p></semantic__clause>

By developing clear, semantic electronic communication standards, UN/CEFACT contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of cross-border trade by reducing the amount of paper necessary for the movement of goods. For example, the BAPLIE UN/EDIFACT message announces the location of each container onboard a container vessel and all the merchandise each contains – this message alone replaces about 1500 sheets of paper per vessel.

The UN/CEFACT Fisheries Language for Universal Exchange (FLUX) standard helps to reduce the challenges of overfishing and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities, supporting efforts to safeguard fish stocks and to reduce the threat to biodiversity. FLUX provides a harmonized message standard that allows fisheries management organizations to automatically access the electronic data from fishing vessels needed for stock management (vessel and trip identification, fishing operations or fishing data such as catch area, species and quantity, date and time). Twenty-three European Union countries are implementing the FLUX standard, representing 85,000 fishing vessels with an annual volume of 5 million tons of fish.

This briefing note discusses the importance of clear semantic data-exchange standards and how this supports both the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA) as well as the United Nations SDGs. The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) aims to be the semantic hub for all trade-related data-exchange standards.</p>

Many paper forms will request specific information such as consignor or consignee, which provides a certain structure; however, depending on the business context and which stakeholder is questioned, such information can be interpreted differently by any recipient. Some paper forms will provide a specific number of spaces: for example, allowing a maximum of three letters (for Yes or No), In this case, responding to a question with “it depends” will exceed the space and should not be possible. The UN Layout Key as defined in UNECE Recommendation 1 describes a way of harmonizing paper document layouts to maximize standardized reading of the data across international trade paper documents. Whilst this has helped since its introduction in the 1970s, it remains a manual human process to access the data, i.e. the data cannot be automatically processed.</p></clause>

The consignor, the buyer, the importer or the freight forwarder are identified in fields dedicated to entering this specific information. An address will usually not be provided as a box of free text, but rather structured in the following manner: address line1, address line2, city name, zip code, country. Very often information will be codified with a clear, limited code list.</p></clause>

If everyone used the same syntax (for example the UN/EDIFACT syntax, which is centrally developed, maintained and published as a global standard) then the information in the message would be clear and everyone would be sure to understand it the same way — whether sending, receiving or consulting.</p></clause>

Many administrations and companies are using the eXtensible Marked-up Language (XML) protocol, which can be very flexible and can be human readable. The base principle of XML is that there are tags which identify types of information with an opening tag and a closing tag containing the same text as the opening tag but preceded by a slash. For example: “&#x3c;importer&#x3e;XXX&#x3c;/importer&#x3e;.” In this example, it is clear that the information which is being transmitted concerns the importer; the name of the importer here is “XXX.”</p></clause>

Every computer programmer can establish their own version of XML. It is often easier for a programmer to create their own logic of XML instead of trying to adhere to a standardized message. The result is a plethora of XML messages and no consistent use of tag naming especially when tags are named in different country languages.</p></clause>

UN/EDIFACT is still widely used in many sectors of activity; EDIFACT-assimilated messages are also being used and which are not completely compliant with the United Nations standard. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is another syntax which is gaining in popularity as it is also rather flexible and it often takes less computer memory.</p></clause>

If there are multiple partners each has their own data exchange syntax, then each one requires a separate mapping. If there is information that is not clearly defined in a data exchange, approximations must be made; these can later cause problems if the type of information they contain is not harmonized. Any change in a message requires an update of the mappings. The syntax must therefore be constantly looked after.</p></clause>

For example, a seal identification number will be linked to the container on which it is affixed, or a city name will be linked to the address to which it refers. Such hierarchies may be differently defined by each sender and this will result in extra problems for receivers increasing exponentially with the number of trading partners that they have.</p></clause>

When faced with new messages which do not align exactly to their version of syntax, the Information Technology (IT) staff within an organization will simply proceed to develop the required mappings. Since many decision makers do not realize what this work entails, they simply trust their computer divisions to do the necessary work. The more data-exchange partners an organization has, the more staff is required to develop and maintain these mappings. This pulls resources away from the core activities of a business in order to deal with an aspect of their business which is purely administrative and costly to the bottom line.</p></clause>

<clause id="_c5693e45-022e-bb72-b492-449a71b9bb93" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><title>12.</title><p id="_e20c3d0d-ca98-1e2b-57cb-860e96fa8229">There are suggestions that artificial intelligence and computer learning or big data techniques can provide these mappings without needing to clearly define the base data elements. This is basing the correlations on ontologies, or relationships between data. In theory, this can be achieved. However, enormous amounts of data are necessary to ensure that the links between different message structures are correct. For common information available on most commercial exchanges, such as traders’ names and addresses, this may be easy to establish. Less frequent information is less likely to be correctly understood. And again, each time there is a change in the message structure on the sending or receiving side, the computer learning will need to re-establish the connections after reaching a critical mass of data.</p></clause>

As these are also usually backwards compatible, there are less problems in potential changes in messages.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT provides the tools to achieve this. Its Core Component Library is a semantic encyclopedia of all data that can potentially be exchanged in a transaction. This model provides the base semantic definitions, the hierarchy of the data in its business context and all relevant code lists. In addition, UN/CEFACT has developed Reference Data Models to manage the information more coherently, providing all the information in the context of a specific sector of activity such as transport logistics or supply chain.</p></clause>

However, much of the WTO TFA refers to electronic exchanges of information and, in light of this, the use of standards will also refer to electronic data-exchange standards.</p></clause>

The time required for processing a transit declaration manually through a paper document will take several hours, if not days, whereas processing it electronically can take a matter of seconds. This is true of almost all border procedures. But in order to gain the benefits of electronic data exchanges, globally harmonized semantic standards must be adopted.</p></clause>

For this reason, most government-run electronic systems will dictate the data to be submitted. This is often defined with national or regional legally mandated regulatory requirements in mind and these may or may not be based on international semantic standards. In contrast, the private sector will often define their data exchange requirements based on the business processes needed to support their trading (not necessarily regulations). This means that when traders are connecting to regulatory systems, they are forced to do a mapping from their trading data semantics to the regulatory data semantics of the government. As with the bridges described above, this can result in misinterpretations and mis-mappings that can be unintentionally (or possibly undetectably intentionally) detrimental to risk assessment and evaluations.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT was established with such a mission in mind. The “FACT” part of UN/CEFACT comes from “UN/EDIFACT”, which means the United Nations Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport. UN/CEFACT was established with both the public sector (administrations) and the private sector (commerce and transport) in mind.

Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a call for action by all countries — poor, rich and middle-income — to promote prosperity while protecting the environment. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, equality and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and working to preserve our ocean and forests.”<fn reference="3"><p id="_2a155d10-aebb-9959-68aa-e9d8e034aa06"><em>UN/CEFACT Prospective Directions</em> strategy document (ECE/TRADE/C/CEFACT/2016/20/Rev.1) paragraph 7.

Target 17 seeks to foster global partnership and to enhance the means for implementation of the goals. It includes several references to information and communication technology and specifically indicates the implementation of the WTO TFA is an integral part of the SDGs in target 17.10.</p></clause>

These include the following themes.</p></clause>

<clause id="_making_semantic_standards_available_free_of_charge" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">A.<tab/>Making semantic standards available free of charge</title>
<clause id="_184a04a2-b458-c5fd-8056-5b35a1d45d04" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><title>25.</title><p id="_525cd77a-4e98-1c27-9c2d-8fe34d5856f3">Several targets of the SDGs foresee that technologies should be made available free of charge. For example, Target 1 on ending poverty seeks to also ensure that all men and women, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, have access to basic services and appropriate technologies. Target 5 foresees the use of enabling technology to promote the empowerment of women. Target 10 seeks to reduce inequalities. By publishing UN/CEFACT semantic standards free of charge and accessible to all, we indirectly support the empowerment and economic inclusion of all.</p></clause>

By developing clear, semantic electronic communication standards, UN/CEFACT contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of cross-border trade by reducing the amount of paper necessary for the movement of goods. For example, the BAPLIE UN/EDIFACT message announces the location of each container onboard a container vessel and all the merchandise each contains – this message alone replaces about 1500 sheets of paper per vessel. UN/CEFACT further develops standards on traceability to confirm that production, transportation and distribution of traded goods are in line with high-level policy objectives of civil society values.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT develops electronic message standards to support trade in agricultural goods. Core to this are agricultural certifications such as the sanitary-phytosanitary certificate (or e-Cert), eQuality certificates (currently being finalized), animal passports, laboratory results, and crop declarations.</p></clause>

UN/CEFACT has also developed clear semantic standards to recall contaminated goods (Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, or RASFF), which have been widely used in the European Union in recent years to recall meats, eggs and other products — thus reducing health risks.</p></clause>

<clause id="_54310d21-8a5d-0289-86ac-dfd27076f766" inline-header="true" obligation="normative"><title>31.</title><p id="_ef1395c0-70d0-8dee-85a2-1228a82481a0">Electronic messages are also key to SDG Target 14 on sustainable marine resources. The UN/CEFACT Fisheries Language for Universal Exchange (FLUX) standard helps to reduce the challenges of overfishing and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities, supporting efforts to safeguard fish stocks and to reduce the threat to biodiversity. FLUX provides a harmonized message standard that allows fisheries management organizations to automatically access the electronic data from fishing vessels needed for stock management (vessel and trip identification, fishing operations or fishing data such as catch area, species and quantity, date and time). Twenty-three European Union countries are implementing the FLUX standard, representing 85,000 fishing vessels with an annual volume of 5 million tons of fish. These messages can also help to provide statistical information on fish catches.</p></clause>

Current UN/CEFACT standards in tourism assist smaller establishments and rural areas to access international markets through electronic data exchange. One such project involves small lodging houses of 100 guest rooms or less, helping them to send electronic business transactions. Another project is looking at experience programs and will soon be working on the base semantic processes and messages to be exchanged to facilitate sharing these offers, thus promoting local culture and products.</p></clause>

These standards include maritime declarations, customs declarations, code lists, and commercial standards (invoicing, packing list, shipping instructions, procurement, etc.) which enable international trade development. This supports the SDG Target 9.1 to develop infrastructure to support economic development with a focus on affordable and equitable access to all.</p></clause>

Serving as the focal point for developing, publishing and maintaining global electronic business standards and trade facilitation recommendations, UN/CEFACT has to date developed over 480 standards and recommendations to achieve improved worldwide coordination and cooperation. It aims to support and facilitate national and international transactions through clear semantic standards and procedures. This directly supports SDG Target 17.8 to provide a technology bank for least developed countries and to enhance the use of enabling technologies.</p></clause>

Most of the meetings are held via conference call, enabling many participants from developing countries to engage and effectively facilitating a North-South sharing of information and semantic standards. This supports SDG Target 17.6 on enhanced knowledge sharing in a neutral United Nations environment.</p></clause>

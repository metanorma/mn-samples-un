<p>This White Paper provides a brief history on standardization of electronic business processes, especially within UN/CEFACT; the basics, benefits and challenges in electronic business processes; the governance of paperless trade; and future evolutions.</p>

<p>This document has been published by the World Economic Forum in October 2017 under the reference 261017, case 00036073.</p>

<p>This document is submitted to the twenty-fourth UN/CEFACT Plenary for noting.</p>
